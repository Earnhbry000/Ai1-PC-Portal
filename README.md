<b><h3>Ai1-Web PC Portal</h3></b>

This is a calm way of allowing everyone a PC for a short period without angering Github and keeping everything within the TOS.

Welcome, This Allows you to rent a windows PC out for 60 minutes and do whatever, THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE EXPOITING OR MINING ON THIS VIRTUAL PC!!!!!

This is acheived using Chrome Remote Desktop & Github Workflows. CRD needs a google account and a good understanding to get a powershell key from SSH setup.

CRD Headless Setup (Get the key here):https://remotedesktop.google.com/headless

Pease Use this responsibly as this is not Stable and does not stay within TOS at this point in time
